## Overview
Python project analyzing financial assets using the **MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence)** indicator. Includes simulations of trades based on historical data for **Gold (XAU/USD)** and **Bitcoin**.

## Features
- Compute MACD and signal line  
- Simulate buy/sell trades  
- Visualize prices, MACD, and trading signals  
- Generate performance statistics  

## Data
- Historical prices from March 2022 â€“ March 2025  
- Source: [Stooq](https://stooq.pl)
  
## Folder Structure

**MACD/**
- **src/**: Contains Python scripts to calculate MACD and run simulations.  
- **data/**: Historical price data used for analysis (CSV format).  
- **results/**: Visualizations and output files generated by the scripts.  
- **.venv/**: Python virtual environment (excluded from GitHub).
